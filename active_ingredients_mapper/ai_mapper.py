                            For the following list of diseases: {diseases_list}, I would like the following information:

                            1. Map each disease to its appropriate active ingredients.

                            5. The list for each disease should contain exactly 3 active ingredients: the option-1  active ingrediant (primary), option-2 active ingrediant, and option-3 active ingrediant (alternatives).
